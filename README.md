# Airbnb-clone-project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.


# Team Roles
1. Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
2. Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


# Technology Stack
1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


# Database Design
The key entities required for the project includes:
1. Users: can have multiple properties
2. Properties: belongs to a user and have multiple reviews
3. Bookings: belongs to a property
4. Payments: belongs to a booking and user
5. Reviews: properties can have multiple reviews 


# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


# API Security
Key security measures that will be implemented includes authentication, authorization, rate limiting etc. These are crucial for protecting user data and securing payments.
1. REST API: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
2. GraphQL API: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.


# CI/CD Pipeline
Using automated development pipelines, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during the deployment phase using tools such as Github Actions or Docker.
